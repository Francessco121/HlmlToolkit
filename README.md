# High Level MAR Language Toolkit

The HLML toolkit is a set of programs meant for building bots for the game [Much Assembly Required](https://github.com/simon987/Much-Assembly-Required) primarily through the use of the High Level MAR Language.

**Note:** This is very much a work in progress, anything could change, and the project is not ready for use.

## Goals
- HLML compiler
- Custom MAR assembler with macro support
- MAR disassembler

## Contents
- [docs](./docs) - Contains the language reference for HLML, the macro MAR assembly language, and documentation of the toolkit.
