# The Macro MAR Assembly Language Reference

The Macro MAR (MMAR) assembler language is a superset of [the game's MAR language](https://github.com/simon987/Much-Assembly-Required/wiki). As implied by the name, the primary goal of MMAR is to support any existing MAR code while also providing extra features such as macros and assembly-time math.

The documentation found here will only be about the extensions MMAR brings. It is assumed that users already know the basics of the [MAR language](https://github.com/simon987/Much-Assembly-Required/wiki).
